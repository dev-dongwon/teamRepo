# Core Concepts

## Local States in Git

### Working Directory:  **Working Directory = **

### **Working Directory + .git (local repo)**       

- The working Directory is a directory or folder on your computer that holds all the projects or application files. This is the place on your system where I would normally create or edit my project files. 
- The files within the working directory may or may not be managed by Git. Normally within the working directory is a hidden folder called the ".git" folder that contains the actual Git repository.

### Staging Area: 

- To **stage** a file is simply to prepare it finely for a commit. *Git, with its index allows you to commit only certain parts of the changes you've done since the last commit.* Say you're working on two features -  one is finished, and one still needs some work done. You'd like to make a commit and go home but wouldn't like to commit the parts of the second feature, which is not done yet. You stage the parts you know belong to the first feature, and commit. Now your commit is your project with the first feature done, while the second is still in work-in-progress in your working directory.

- Broken Metaphor time:

  Consider a scenario where you call the movers to get your stuff from your old apartment to your new apartment. Before you do that, you will go through your stuff, decide what you take with you and what you throw away, pack it in bags and leave it the main hallway. The movers will simply come, get the bags which have been already packed from the hallway and transport them. In this example, everything until the movers get your stuff, is staging: you decide what goes where, how to pack it and so on (e.g. you may decide that half your stuff will be thrown away before the movers even get there - that's part of staging).

  From a technical point of view, staging also supports transactional commits, by splitting all operations into what can fail (staging) and what cannot fail (commit):

  The commit in git is implemented transaction, after the staging is successful. Several steps in the staging can fail (for example, you need to commit, but your HDD is 99.9999% full, and git has no space to perform a commit). This will fail in staging (your repository will not be corrupted by a partial commit) and the staging process doesn't affect your commit history (it doesn't corrupt your repository in case of an error).

### Repository (.git folder) - (Remote Storage)

# Commits

- Change Set

  - Collection of changes from One or many files.
  - Like mentioned before those changes are collected in the staging area before being committed
  - Once a commit happens and get all the changes in the staging area are saved as a single commit, which is known as Atomic commit

- Atomic

  - All changes from Stage
  - The commit is recorded into the get repository and given a unique identifier which is SHA-1 Hash.

- SHA-1 Hash Identifier

  - Can be abbreviated.
  - Used to refer to commit history.
  - This SHA-1 commit ID is used to refer specific commits throughout the Git repository's history.

- Timelines

  - Commits are permanently recoded on a timeline known as a **branch**
  - **branch**es are just names of independent and sometimes shared timelines of commits or changes.
  - All Git repositories contain at least one branch (The default Branch).
  - The main branch in Git is named **Master**.
  - Therefore, when creating a fresh new Git repository, Git automatically creates the master branch.

  - Even though It is possible to have many numbers of branches in a Git, I would recommend keeping it simple as possible as you can.
